### **Bad Example (Score: 4)**

#### **User Input:**

> Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

#### **Score: 4/10**

#### **Reasons for Low Score:**

- ❌ **Vocabulary table is incomplete**—Japanese characters are missing.
- ❌ **Unnecessary introductory text** before the vocabulary table.
- ❌ **Clues improperly provide polite verb forms**—students must determine politeness levels themselves.
- ❌ **Sentence structure gives too much detail**—it should be conceptual and minimal.

#### **Assistant Output (Bad Example):**

```plaintext
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

| Japanese | Romaji | English |
|----------|--------|---------|
|          | kuma   | bear    |
|          | tobira | door    |
|          | gomi   | garbage |
|          | noko   | leave behind |

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "Did you leave the garbage out?"
For the first clause, we can use the verb (aru) which means "to exist" or "to be present." We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
For the second clause, we can use the verb (nokosu), which is a more polite way of saying "to leave behind." Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb.

### **Sentence Structure**
**[Clause 1: Bears are at the door]**
[Subject] wa [Location] ni [Verb] desu

**[Clause 2: Did you leave the garbage out?]**
[Verb] masu ka
